## About the Project
This is a web page for the fictional client Tórshavn Science Museum. 

The aim was to use the new knowledgde of project planning, web design and development I have learned over the first semester of the Front-end Development studies at Noroff.

To do that, I was "hired" to design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client. Images and text was provided. 

#### Info about the client and instructions:
- Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.
- The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.


I wanted to create an informatic and well organized site with a design appealing to a grown up focus group. I wanted the information a typical parent first look for, the museums opening hours, location and other practical info, to be easy to find. At the same time I wished to keep the playfulness to target the main audience, the kids. I wanted a colourful design that was easy to manouver for both kids and adults, and I wanted the page to invite kids to click around on it and find the content easy, interesting and fun to read.
