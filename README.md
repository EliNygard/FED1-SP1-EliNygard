## Description
This is a blog page for the fictional client HotView Labs. 

The goal was to put into practice the skills I have learned over the FED1 program, the first year of the Front-end Development studies at Noroff. 
To do that, I was "hired" to build a front-end user interface for an exisiting API blogging application. The client asked for a responsive application that allow users to view dynamic blog posts. The client required admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts.

#### Info about the client:
- Name: HotView Labs
- Sector: Tech Research and Development
- Size: 30 employees
- Location: Worldwide
- Mission: Provide the most accurate and up to date insights to tech leaders across the world.
